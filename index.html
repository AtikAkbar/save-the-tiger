            <p>After a century of decline, overall wild tiger numbers are starting to tick upward. Based on the best available information, tiger populations are stable or increasing in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China. An estimated 3,900 tigers remain in the wild, but much more work is needed to protect this species if we are to secure its future in the wild. In some areas, including much of Southeast Asia, tigers are still in crisis and declining in number.</p>

                <h3>Protect Tiger Habitat</h3>
                <p>Tigers have lost an estimated 95% of their historical range. Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded, and fragmented by human activities. By saving biologically diverse places, we will allow tigers to roam and preserve the many other endangered species that live there.  </p>

            <h2>Why should </h2>
            <h2>We Save The Tigers ?</h2>
            <p>Tigers are crucial to the health of the ecosystems in which they live. Thriving tiger population indicates an intact balance between apex predators, herbivores and vegetation. Tigers are also an ‘umbrella species’. They require large areas of intact forest to survive, so tiger conservation means protecting many other species in the same area.</p>

            <h2>Our Effort</h2>
            <h2>In Saving The Tigers :</h2>
            <p>We work to enforce zero tolerance for tiger poaching across Asia. We help build the capacity of government enforcement units in each landscape and install the best new technologies to assist local agencies by achieving conservation results. We help improve the effectiveness of wildlife rangers by training personnel from enforcement agencies on tools such as SMART (Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool). We also work to ensure that communities have a stake in conservation, as they are typically the best stewards and managers of their natural resources.</p>
